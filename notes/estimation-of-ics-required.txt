Aruino mega
  16 analog inputs
  54 digital outputs

We have a 56 x 50 sensor array so need to expand the number of both inputs and outputs.

We've got 2 options

1. Try and understand the example and code provided by sensitronics
http://sensitronics.com/tutorials/fsr-matrix-array/page2.php

2. Work from first principles (using effectively same hardware)

Looking at arduino basic documentation

4051 analog multiplexor:
http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/4051

595 shift register:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ShiftOut

If we follow the sensitronics model I think we need
 7 x 4051 ic's
 7 x 595 ic's
 14 x 0.1uF capacitors

This will use only 1 analog input on the arduino (have to iterate over ic's might be slower)
This will use 33 digital pins on the arduino

If we build up from basic circuit diagrams I think we need
  7 x 4051 ic's
  7 x 595 ic's
  7 x 0.1uF capacitors
  

This could use 7 analog inputs on the arduino for faster sampling
This could use 42 digital pins
